## System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **News Ingestion** → Raw articles from multiple sources
2. **LLM Extraction** → Structured signals with confidence scores
3. **Signal Storage** → Player signals (injuries, form, transfers)
4. **Matching Engine** → Filter candidates → Rank with multi-factor scoring
5. **Explanation Layer** → Generate explainable recommendations
6. **Feedback Loop** → Club feedback improves future rankings

### Scoring Components

#### Final Score Formula
```
Final Score = 
  (Fit Score × 0.35) +
  (Performance Score × 0.25) +
  (Availability Score × 0.20) +
  (News Confidence × 0.15) -
  (Risk Penalty × 0.05)
```

**Fit Score (35%)**: Position, age, budget, tactical fit
**Performance Score (25%)**: Recent form, consistency
**Availability Score (20%)**: Injury/suspension status
**News Confidence (15%)**: Recent news signal confidence
**Risk Penalty (5%)**: Injury, suspension, disciplinary history

---

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **players**: Player profiles with demographics and contract info
- **clubs**: Club information and league data
- **club_needs**: Club-specific requirements for recruitment
- **player_signals**: Risk indicators, form, news-driven signals
- **player_performance**: Season statistics and metrics
- **news_articles**: Raw football news articles
- **news_extractions**: LLM-extracted structured information
- **recommendations**: Ranked player recommendations
- **club_feedback**: Club feedback on recommendations

---

## LLM Intelligence

### News Extraction
The system uses OpenAI GPT-4 to:
1. Identify entities (players, clubs)
2. Classify event types (transfer, injury, contract, form)
3. Extract facts from unstructured text
4. Assign confidence scores
5. Distinguish rumors from confirmed facts

### Key Constraints
- **No rumors as facts**: Rumors marked with confidence < 0.7
- **Evidence-based**: Only extract explicitly stated facts
- **Language support**: English, Arabic, German
- **Confidence weighted**: News confidence influences final scores

---

## Real-Time Updates

### Automatic Refresh Triggers
- Major news events (transfer confirmed, injury)
- Club profile updates
- Scheduled: Every 30 minutes (configurable)

### Caching Strategy
- Recommendations cached for 24 hours
- Invalidated on significant news
- Player signals auto-expire based on event type

---

## Data Sources & Licensing

### Approved Sources
- ESPN (public API)
- Sky Sports (with permission/scraping rules)
- Goal.com (with terms compliance)
- Transfermarkt (attribution required)
- Official club announcements

### Legal Compliance
✓ No ToS-violating scraping
✓ Proper attribution for all data
✓ Respect for robot.txt
✓ Rate limiting on external APIs

---

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for all required variables

### Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:setup    # Create schema
npm run db:seed     # Seed initial data
```

### Production Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] JWT authentication configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Error logging set up
- [ ] LLM API key secured
- [ ] CORS configured for frontend domain

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
psql -h localhost -U sportify_user -d sportify_ai
```

### LLM API Errors
Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` and verify rate limits.

### News Ingestion Delays
Monitor `logs/` for ingestion errors. Adjust `NEWS_INGEST_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.
